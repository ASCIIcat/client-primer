# NOTICE:

Its very highly likely any files in here are here temporarily and will be moved once
i figure out how to refactor the code to be more modular.



## Toybox notes:
- Code was horribly optimized, so messy it needed mediators.
- Find better way to organize the code structure for the vibe, possibly structure it for UI first logic second.

- Basically, i feel like it will be easier to transfer everything in now as a "TEMPORAY STRUCTURE" so its all here for reference.
- AFTER THAT, i can go through and try to create the UI, then polish the logic for it as I make the UI, instead of the other way around.
