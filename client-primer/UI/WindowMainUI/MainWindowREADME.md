# CURRENT PLAN FOR THE MAIN WINDOW UI

- The basic constraints will remain the same in terms of size.
- The main window's UI should mimic the layout of the Lovense App.


## What will stay?:
- The server connection info will remain. It will be condensed at the top with separators like usual

## What will change?:
- The current top 3 buttons are will no longer dropdown to show additional options or whatever, it will be a icon tab bar.
- The main window's icon bar will have the following selections:
    - Home (Modules/Component Dashboard)
    - Whitelist (Alt Names: Pairs, Contacts, Users)
    - Discover (Displays a browsable menu for published patterns, kind of like a social feature)
    - Me (Alt Names: Profile, Account) ((May replace some of the tabs in settings UI but we'll see.))



- Home Page will contain a preview interface of each component you can interact with, giving User's easy access.
    - Remote (Vibrator Remote Controller)
    - Orders (Orders given to you by others you given access to. If you do not complete them within the expected deadline, you will be penalized.)
    - Gags (pulls out to the separate GagSetupUI)
    - Wardrobe (Opens the fancier Wardrobe UI)
    - Puppeteer (Pulls open standalone Puppeteer UI)
    - Toybox (contains patterns, triggers, (and alarms??))
    - Alarms ( Alarms Window )
    - [ And more to come with each update... ]

- The Whitelist / Pairs / Contacts / Users Page will contain the same layout as old UI, with search filter and add user button (UID at top)

- The Discover Page is a feature creep concept but also something I can get working at a base level. Discover Tab will be a place for:
    - A Browsable Pattern Library, contains downloads, likes, and more. User's can upload created patterns anonymously or with credit if they desire.
    - A Browsable Trigger Library, contains downloads, likes, and more. User's can upload created triggers anonymously or with credit if they desire.
    - [Heavy Feature Creep & likely no add] Chat room space for sub/doms to make rooms and join with each other for some kinky fun.

- The Me / Profile / Account Page contains buttons for opening the following windows:
    - My Profile (Opens the profile editor UI)
    - Safeword Display (Field to insert safeword of choice)
    - Settings (Opens the settings UI)
    - Help (Opens the help UI)
    - About (Opens plugin about popup)
    - Additional Buttons for opening plugin config directory, feedback page, ext.
